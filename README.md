## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram

We propose creating a user-friendly website that integrates mapping services to help users locate the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facilities easily. The site will feature educational pop-ups to enlighten users about the harmful components of e-waste and their environmental and human health impacts if not disposed of correctly. Additionally, a rewards program will incentivize users to participate in responsible e-waste disposal by offering credits based on the precious metals recovered from their old devices. Users can input their device models to estimate the amount of precious metals, earning credits accordingly. The website will have a responsive design, ensuring accessibility across various devices, and a backend database to store facility information and user profiles securely. Thorough testing and optimization will guarantee smooth functionality, while promotion through social media and partnerships with environmental organizations will increase awareness and usage. This comprehensive solution aims to empower users to make environmentally conscious choices while offering tangible rewards for their efforts in e-waste recycling.
